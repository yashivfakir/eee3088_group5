\section{Definitions}

Node - A single sensing device on a pole that meshes with other nodes to form the sensing network

\section{End User Specifications}

The aim of the comissioned sensing and reporting system is to identify and report faults on 33kV transmission lines 
that do not trigger an earth leakage or overcurrent fault condition on existing switching systems, yet still pose 
a safety risk to the public. Such faults are often caused by storm damage, motor/construction vehicle impact and 
malicious damage to public property generally caused by theft. In addition to post-fault reporting the early recognition
of structural degridation can potentially save the Utility money by allowing planned and targeted maintainence to prevent 
future unexpected faults.

\subsection{Definition of desired detactable fault conditions}
The following fault conditoins are desirted to be detected by the comissioned system:

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[htp]
  %\caption{Definition of desired detactable fault conditions}
  
  \hskip-2.2cm\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|p{10cm}|}
      \hline
      \textbf{Image} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
      \hline
      One & Phase failure & Loss of energy of one or more lines due to faults between the node and the supply \\
       & Line detachment & One or more lines are detachted from the isolator on the A-frame while the pole remains
       upright \\
       & Pole dislodged and/or rotated & Pole is no longer upright or loses orientated through forces on the lines or pole itself \\
       & Pole failure & The structure of the pole is compromised due to material failure \\
       & Pole fracture & The pole remains upright, the strength is however compromised due to any number of fractures \\
       & Pole and node failure due to damaging force & A damaging force is strong enough to damage both the pole and the
       node\\
       & Fire in vicinity of transmission line & \\
      \hline

  \end{tabular}    

\label{tab:summary_measurments}
\end{table}
\end{center}

% TODO: Put these into tables later on

\subsection{Reporting requirements for faults}
Faults that compromise the safety of the public should be reported as fast as possible and in no more than 10 minutes.

Fault conditions that  precede an immminent future failure should be reported within 24 hours of the condition being
detected.

\subsection{Durability and cost of operation}
The sensing devices (nodes) should not be required to be serviced for 10 years after installation.

The nodes should not rely on subsription services (such as GSM) for operation.

\subsection{Component cost}
A bill of materials of single device should exceed 250 ZAR.
