\section{End User Specifications}

The aim of the comissioned sensing and reporting system is to identify and report faults on 33kV transmission lines 
that do not trigger an earth leakage or overcurrent fault condition on existing switching systems, yet still pose 
safety risk to the public. Such faults are often caused by storm damage, motor/construction vehicle impact and malicious
damage to public property generally caused by theft. In addition to post-fault reporting the early recognition of 
structural degridation can potentially save the Utility money by allowing planned and targeted maintainence to prevent 
future unexpected faults.

\subsection{Definition of desired detactable fault conditions}
The following fault conditoins are desirted to be detected by the comissioned system:
